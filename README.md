## My process

Planned the layout, built semantic HTML, styled with flex and grid, added hover effects, inner strokes, and drop shadows. Made it responsive using media queries, then tested across screen sizes for polish.


### Built with

- HTML
- CSS


### What I learned

Built a fully responsive blog card using semantic HTML, flex and grid layouts, hover effects, and shadows.

### Continued development

Going forward, I plan to explore more advanced responsive techniques, interactive animations, and reusable card components for larger projects.
